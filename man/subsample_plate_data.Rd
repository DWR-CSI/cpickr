\title{Subsample Plate Data for Cherrypicking}
\usage{
subsample_plate_data(plate_data, sample_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate_data}{A data frame or tibble containing plate data with at least a SampleID
column. Typically also contains PlateID and WellID columns for use with other cpickr
functions.}

\item{sample_ids}{A character vector of SampleIDs to keep in the subsampled dataset.
These represent the specific samples to be cherrypicked.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing only the rows with SampleIDs present in the sample_ids list,
maintaining all original columns and their values. The function provides a message indicating
how many samples were found compared to the number requested.
}
\description{
This function subsamples a plate dataset to include only the specified SampleIDs,
which is useful for creating cherrypicking lists for Hamilton robots. The function
filters the input dataset to retain only the samples of interest while preserving
their plate and well locations.
}
\examples{
plate_data <- data.frame(
  SampleID = c("S1", "S2", "S3", "S4", "S5"),
  PlateID = c("P1", "P1", "P1", "P2", "P2"),
  Well = c("A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2")
)
sample_ids_to_keep <- c("S1", "S3", "S5")
subsample_plate_data(plate_data, sample_ids_to_keep)
}
